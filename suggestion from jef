suggestion from jef

design your mono repo to be, surprise, a MONOREPO
- you have too many repos


if you want to use mononrepo
- add python code, javascript, web, api, etc, to the same repo
- deploy all of them using Devopness
- you will have clear visibility of all the changes that happens in all parts of the system (your product) from Devopness dashboard
- you will have a single path to deploy your product, even if you change programming languages and frameworks in the future
- also you can quyicly try your AI code in other cloud providers, such as a GCP and Azure, if you get credits from them
