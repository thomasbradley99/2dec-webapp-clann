## Development Planning

### GraphQL Schema
We need to define the GraphQL schema that AppSync will use, based on our PostgreSQL schema.

### AWS Infrastructure Setup
- Amplify configuration files
- RDS security groups
- S3 bucket policies
- Cognito user pool settings

### Type Definitions
Need TypeScript interfaces for:
- Database models
- API responses
- State management
- Component props

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests
   - Components
   - Hooks
   - Utilities

2. Integration Tests
   - API integration
   - Authentication flows
   - File uploads

3. E2E Tests
   - User journeys
   - Admin workflows
   - Analysis workflows

### Error Handling
- Global error boundary
- API error responses
- Form validation
- Authentication errors

### Security Considerations
- CORS policies
- JWT token management
- S3 bucket access
- RDS access patterns

### Deployment Process
1. AWS Configuration
2. Database Migration
3. Environment Setup
4. CI/CD Pipeline
